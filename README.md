<h1><strong>Cryptocurrency Transaction System</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Abstract:</strong></h2>
<p>
This project is aimed at developing a system which helps in storing the details of a transaction which happens during a cryptocurrency transaction. With the rising interest of people towards the new and fascinating world of cryptocurrency, more and more technologies are being developed to keep this transaction safe, secure and error proof. The most advanced systems which handle these transactions implement a technology known as blockchain. Since this technology is beyond the scope of the project, we will try building a simple system using databases. The system will consist of various tables which will help in keeping records of the prices of the coins, the transaction log between different users, etc.
 <br>
The project will create multiple entities to demonstrate a smooth transaction between two individuals dealing in cryptocurrency.
